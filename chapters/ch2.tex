\section{Introduction}

\noindent
This chapter aims to provide some general information regarding to common practices within structural Life-Cycle Management (LCM) mainly for steel structures that are vulnerable against 
fatigue (e.g. bridges, off-shore structures, wind turbines, etc. ). This is helpful to highlight the challenges during the structural LCM to be able to integrate and relate the work 
that is conducted in this thesis. Structural LCM is composed of different blocks in which an optimal maintenance and/or inspection planning can be derived as a result. The LCM introduced 
here is incorporated with the information from Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) and probabilistic modeling. This will lead to a more realistic outcomes that is very resourceful for decision
makers. For this reason, the objectives and strategies of structural maintenance are introduced first. Then, models for structural performance deterioration and performance indicators are 
reviewed. Common methods for fatigue life assessment of steel structures accompanied with uncertainty modeling in fatigue and performance functions for fatigue reliability analysis are 
investigated subsequently. In the next step, some methods for monitoring, inspection, and maintenance for fatigue are summarized. In the end, life-cycle optimization of structures associated
with monitoring, inspection, and maintenance is characterized. 


\section{Structural life-cycle management}

\noindent
Most of the civil engineering structures are built to perform their desired functions for decades. They play a crucial task to improve the economy in addition to social and environmental
welfare. However, these national assets are exposed to different aging processes (e.g. fatigue and corrosion for steel structures), random loading and environmental conditions (e.g. 
storms, snow, etc.), and some other natural extreme events such as earthquakes and those resulting from humans such as accidents and terrorist attacks. Apart from the unexpected accidents, 
deterioration is one of the unpleasant processes that happens to any structure by the passage of the time, no matter how well it is designed. A sudden failure in civil structures can have 
major economic, environmental, and social impacts, see e.g. collapse of Genoa bridge. Therefore, the cost of a failure can be much higher than the cost required only for rebuilding or 
replacing the structure \citep{Dong2013, Bocchini2014}. In order to ensure the long-term functionality of structures, it then becomes crucial to plan some interventions to reduce the 
number of unexpected failures. These interventions can involve maintenance actions, periodic inspections, and SHM. 

However, the number of scheduled interventions should be considered reasonably during the service life of a structure since it can lead to a big financial burden. Proposing an integrated
framework is thus inevitable to evaluate the conflicting safety and financial requirements altogether in the context of structural LCM. Life-cycle cost optimization is one
important step in LCM process since financial limitations can significantly impact further decisions. A rational trade-off between the minimization of the life-cycle cost and maximization 
of the expected service life is sought. The optimization part can be a computationally expensive process especially when it is performed in a probabilistic framework to account for associated 
uncertainties. However, recent advances in processing tools make it easier to conduct such calculations in a large-scale simulation \citep{Okasha2010, Okasha2011}. 

A comprehensive LCM is composed of different modules that work in an integrated way which for example aim to minimize the life-cycle cost, maximize the extended service life, etc. 
Figure \ref{fig:maintenance_flow} illustrates the general framework for a LCM for deteriorating structures. Structural LCM starts with analyzing the structure under investigation to determine
the deteriorating mechanisms affecting the structure. 
In this step, one should specify some details about the structure such as type of the structure, type of material, and details of components. Depending on the type of structure and material,
different types of deterioration process can be considered. For instance, fatigue and corrosion are common processes that cause deterioration in steel structures while in concrete structures
carbonation and chloride penetration are dominant. Considering each process, structural performance can be evaluated using appropriate approaches. For instance, S-N approach and fracture 
mechanism can be used to model the fatigue damage in steel structures. Since this study concentrates more on steel structures, S-N curves and fracture mechanism will be introduced with more details in Section
\ref{sec:fatigue}. Another step in structural LCM is employing SHM data which helps to reduce the uncertainty in predicting structural performance. To make the decision making process easier some 
performance indicators such as reliability or risk are required in the next step. After predicting the deterioration of performance indicators over time, appropriate maintenance actions are 
chosen to improve the structural performance. The effect of maintenance actions associated with their costs are used in the optimization step to be able to propose appropriate outcomes such 
as optimum maintenance and inspection strategy, optimum expected extended service life, etc. Such framework has been presented in 
\citet{Frang2011, Frang2012, Miyamoto2015} that is already applied on different types of structures such as bridges \citep{KIM20111, KIM2012, KWON2011, Nader2010} and sea vessels 
\citep{KIM2011, Kim201111, kwon2012, Kwon20122}.

\end{figure*}

It is obvious that providing a comprehensive LCM framework facilitates the process of inspection and maintenance planning for structures within the financial restrictions. However, it
can be considered as an extensive mission that requires schooling in many other fields such as structural analysis, reliability assessment, etc. Addressing challenges in the related 
fields , of course, can help to improve the results of LCM approaches. For such purposes, some studies focus on new methods and approaches to approximate the performance indicators 
such as reliability or risk indices in a time-dependent or time independent framework, while others are searching for more appropriate cost models. Quantifying uncertainties is another 
active field in this domain that can be of a great help to improve the practices in structural LCM. Thus, the goal of this chapter is to describe different steps in structural LCM against 
fatigue with more details to clarify the objectives and challenges in this framework. 

\section{Structural maintenance objectives and strategies}

\noindent
Simply speaking, structural maintenance means "to retain a structure in a good condition so that it can accomplish its expected tasks" \citep{Van1994}. This definition may imply that 
all the components of a structure should be in a nearly-new condition so a structure can fulfill all intended duties. However, financial and physical limitations force the managers to 
find more sophisticated solutions for maintaining structures in which the targets and the limitations are clearly specified and addressed. Some targets for the structural maintenance 
can be expressed in terms of reliability, availability, durability, serviceability, etc. Finally, the maintenance can be defined as:
"All technical activities on the component level linked to each other in order to keep the structure in a condition to perform its duties properly for a specified period of time 
to satisfy maintenance targets (e.g. sufficient reliability, or availability, etc.)" \citep{Van1994}. 

Maintenance targets rely on measurements that evaluate the performance of a structure which deteriorate over time due to different degradation processes. Therefore, the main goal of 
maintenance actions is to improve the performance of structures to meet those targets. As those measurements inherently deteriorate through time due to different aging processes, one
main goal of maintenance actions is to restore the initial properties of the structure completely or at least partially in order to meet the requirements expressed in terms of 
maintenance targets. The cost of maintenance represents a non-neglegible portion in total the life-cycle cost of a structure since maintenance actions are meant to apply frequently 
during its service life and it can even be higher than the original cost of construction \citep{Allen2001}. Therefore, another 
objective is to search for an economically balanced maintenance allocation. In other words, this can be considered as another target that defines the financial 
limitations for the maintenance planning. Hence, optimizing the maintenance planning seems to be of paramount importance because it tries to find the best maintenance strategies for 
given level of targets and financial constraints. 

%Considering this sophisticated approach of maintenance, essential features related to the structure and maintenance need to be considered. A civil engineering structure, such as
%bridges, is a system composed of many component and the maintenance, in essence, take place at the component level. One should choose a maintenance strategy not only according to the 
%component characteristics but also by considering the consequences at the structure level and the impacts on the structural performance. 

Maintenance actions are generally employed to change the course of the structural deterioration. They can mainly be grouped in two categories namely preventive and corrective actions
, see Figure \ref{fig:maintenancetypes}. The goal of preventive maintenance interventions is either to stop or slow down the aging process which can help to extend the service life 
of a structure. Preventive maintenance actions are usually applied based on a planned schedule. However, sometimes according to the condition of the structure, preventive maintenance 
can be recommended. The second category of maintenance interventions are called corrective actions since 
they are performed to restore the performance of some components of the structure partially or totally. Corrective maintenance are usually performed when the performance indicators 
reaches a predefined threshold. This kind of maintenance can be planned or unplanned due to some unwanted accidents on the structure \citep{BARONE201421}.

\begin{figure*}[hbt!]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{figures/fig-ch1/maintenance.pdf}
  \caption{Different types of maintenance actions}
  \label{fig:maintenancetypes}
\end{figure*}

The effect of preventive and corrective maintenance actions on the structural performance is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:maintenanceffect} in addition to the cumulative cost of
maintenance. The service life of a 
structure can be defined when the structural performance reaches its threshold. Preventive and corrective maintenance actions are applied to keep the structural performance above
the threshold and therefore to extend the structural service life \citep{Kong2003a, Kong2003b, Neves2006}. Time instants for applying the preventive maintenance actions can be
preplanned considering the structural performance evolution and the cost 
of maintenance \citep{Nader2010}. The preventive maintenance actions can lead to small improvements on the performance of a structure at a lower cost compared to the corrective actions.  
Corrective maintenance interventions are usually performed when the performance of the structure is reaching its threshold and an essential improvement such as replacement is necessary
which consequently lead to a higher cost of maintenance \citep{Farngbook2019}.

\section{Structural performance deterioration models}

\noindent
One of the most important steps in structural life-cycle analysis is the evaluation and prediction of the structural performance deterioration \citep{Frang2011, Farngbook2018}. 
Aging and degradation are some other terms that are usually used instead of deterioration. Combined effect of some drivers of operating environment (more or less harsh) and
mechanical stressors trigger the structure to degrade over time \citep{Farngbook2019}. An accurate model for structural deterioration process can be a major tool for the 
life-cycle management of a structure. Fatigue and corrosion are the most common degradation processes on steel structures that cause the 
structural performance to deteriorate gradually over time. However, there are some other extreme events like earthquakes, floods, etc. that cause an unanticipated change 
in the structural performance \citep{fransoli2016}. 

Performance degradation of structures can have different behavior depending on the governing failure mode. Figure \ref{fig:degradation} illustrates some of possible 
deterioration patterns. For instance, the case one which is a linear degradation pattern can be used to model the corrosion process over time for many cases. 
Case 2 represents a process that slows down by the passage of the time which can be used to represent the carbonation and chloride penetration in concrete structures.
Fatigue behavior is similar to case 3 where the deterioration is caused by the cumulative load effect over time and the failure occurs by abruptly. 
In some cases, the degradation process has a stepwise behavior since it happens by collisions and extreme loads (case 4). In case 5, structure
experiences a sudden failure since an unexpected extreme load can exceed the structural tolerance level. As many of the components in the civil engineering structures are 
covered with a protection layer, they may show a two-phase degradation process, see case 6 on Figure \ref{fig:degradation}. The first phase is related to the degradation of the 
protection layer and in the second phase the component degrades \citep{Van1994}. 

Maintenance strategy highly depends on the type of the degradation model. 
For instance, if defects or cracks are assumed to exist before the beginning of structural service life, which is the case in a damage tolerance analysis, cracks should be detected 
before reaching a critical value. Therefore, regular inspections should be planned during the service life of a structure. If a crack is detected in a critical fatigue
detail by inspections, preventive or corrective maintenance actions should then be performed promptly since the stable crack growth phase is not so long compared to the total
service life of a structure. For a two-phased degradation process (case 6), the aging process in the first phase that is related to the protection layer can be considered as a 
conditional parameter for the second phase which is related to the component deterioration. If there is only one degradation phase (case 1 to 5), it is important to properly 
predict the behavior of the process since it is the only indicator to decide about the inspection and maintenance actions. Fatigue as one of the most important aging process for 
steel structures is introduced in Section \ref{sec:fatigue} because the aim here is to contribute to the optimal maintenance planning of structures against fatigue. 

\begin{figure*}[hbt!]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{figures/fig-ch1/degradation.pdf}
  \caption{Different courses of structural performance degradation over time}
  \label{fig:degradation}
\end{figure*}

The existence of uncertainties within the aging processes increases the complexity of the problem for damage occurrence, propagation and detection. In 
general, uncertainties can be classified in two groups. The first group gathers randomness which is inherent to the parameters, and it is called aleatory uncertainty. 
The second group gathers uncertainties due to the lack of knowledge about a phenomenon and it is referred to epistemic uncertainties. \citep{RAHMAN201862, KARANKI201791, FERCHICHI201724}. 
Aleatory uncertainties are usually irreducible while epistemic uncertainties can be reduced by adding extra information to the problem (e.g with a more realistic modeling). 
Therefore, Structural performance indicators are better to be derived in a probabilistic framework which is suitable to account for uncertainties in the problem. One can refer to 
reliability, risk, availability, and hazard as indicators that take into account associated uncertainties in the problem. They are hence introduced in the next section. 



\section{Structural performance indicators for maintenance allocation}
\label{sec:indic}
\noindent
Structural performance indicators are crucial for maintenance allocation and optimization since they provide consistent criteria for decision making process \citep{Ghosn2016}. 
Performance indicators are time-dependent functions that can be measured and quantified. It is evident that a careful assessment of performance indicators over time can help
for a better structural maintenance planning. 

Condition index is one of the most common performance indicators that is attained through visual inspections \citep{Str2017, Farngbook2019}. Using this performance indicator, 
the condition of the structure is rated in different scales after each inspection. For instance National Bridge Inventory (NBI) and Pontis are two condition rating methods that 
are used in the United states \citep{MASCIOTTA2016, Farngbook2019}. NBI rates the condition of bridge components (such as deck, superstructures, etc) using a value ranging from 
0 to 9 where 0 indicates the failing condition and 9 shows the excellent condition. In Pontis condition rating method, however, the rating is from 1 to 5 where 1 indicates "no 
evidence of damage in a bridge component" and 5 represents "severe damage which affect the serviceability of a bridge component". Table \ref{tab:conditionindex} describes the condition
states in Pontis condition rating method \citep{Farngbook2019}. Other countries such as Austria and Croatia use the condition rating method that is similar to Pontis and the structural condition is 
described with 5 condition states \citep{Str2017}. Condition rating of components is prepared mostly by visual inspection within different methods and usually provides qualitative 
information about components of the structure (as it can be seen from Table \ref{tab:conditionindex} for Pontis condition rating). The quality of data is highly dependent on the 
inspector's skills, rush level of the inspector, accessibility to the inspections zone, etc.

\end{table}

Other relevant performance indicators can be used in the area of structural maintenance planning such as reliability, availability, hazard, and risk based indicators \citep{BARONE201421}. 
These indicators provide quantitative information about the deterioration of structural performance that can be easier to interpret and evaluate the structural performance.
Some countries like Netherlands and Denmark have started to employ those indicators more comprehensively in the field of structural maintenance planning and not only for research 
purposes \citep{Str2017}. Reliability and risk-based indicators rely on the failure probability, assessed in practice from the so-called performance function (which is described in Section
\ref{sec:riliabilityandrisk}), while availability and hazard are directly calculated according to the lifetime distribution. In the latter approach, the lifetime of a structure is considered
as a random variable \citep{OKASHA2010520}. A probabilistic framework for the life cycle management allows one to take into account uncertainties associated with structural resistance 
and loads, and therefore to compute those performance indicators. A short description for the mentioned indicators is provided hereafter.

\subsection{Reliability and risk indicators}
\label{sec:riliabilityandrisk}
\noindent
$\bullet$ \textit{Reliability} measures the probability that a structure performs its duties properly for a given period of time under specified conditions. One goal of reliability analysis is to
find the probability of failure of a structure from its behavior for a given failure mode that is formulated by means of a performance function $Z = G(\textbf{X})$. $\textbf{X}$ here denotes
a vector of input random variables that encompasses for example mechanical properties, operational parameters, and load characteristics. $G(\textbf{X})=0$ separates the safe domain 
$G(\textbf{X})>0$ from the failure domain $G(\textbf{X})<0$ and it is called the limit state. The probability of failure for a given failure mode is  
expressed by the integration of the joint probability density function $f_{\textbf{X}}(\textbf{x})$ of the random vector $\textbf{X}$ over the failure domain as it is formulated in Equation 
\ref{eq:pfailure} \citep{Huang2017, Barron2007}. 

\begin{equation}
 p_f = P(G(\textbf{X})\leq 0) = \int ... \int_{G(\textbf{X})<0}f_{\textbf{X}}(\textbf{x})d\textbf{x}
 \label{eq:pfailure}
\end{equation}

\noindent
Calculating this failure probability is not an easy task and increasingly robust and efficient reliability methods have been proposed over the last decades to approximate 
this failure probability. This formulation is related to the time-independent reliability analysis and evaluates the failure probability for a given time instant. However, in many of
engineering applications, time-dependent reliability analysis is necessary due to the temporal nature of material properties, loading, and geometrical parameters. Time-variant reliability 
analysis is more complicated than time-invariant analysis by introducing the time into the problem and it aims to calculate the cumulative failure probability for a given time interval. 
More information about methods and definitions for reliability analysis is provided in Chapter 3 where a new approach for time-dependent reliability analysis is developed. The new method
is called AK-SYS-T. 


%very challenging due to the difficulties of obtaining the $f_{\textbf{X}}(\textbf{x})$ and performing the multiple integral over the failure domain. 
%Therefore, several reliability methods have been proposed to approximate this failure probability including simulation-based methods such as Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS), importance 
%sampling, directional sampling, etc., approximation techniques such as First Order and Second Order Reliability Methods (FORM and SORM) \cite{Melchers1999}, and hybrid methods which 
%combine for example surrogate models and simulation-based methods such as  AK-MCS \cite{ECHARD2011145}, EGRA \cite{Ranjan2008}, PCE \cite{BLATMAN2010183}, and Adaptive Support Vector 
%Regression (AVSR) \cite{BOURINET2016210}.

%The previous formulation for reliability analysis considers time-independent problems. Hence, the aforementioned methods are used to obtain the probability of failure for a given time instant. 
%In most of the reliability problems, time-variant analysis is inevitable due to the temporal nature of material properties, loading, and geometrical parameters. Time-variant reliability 
%analysis is more complicated than time-invariant analysis by introducing the time into the problem. The general time-dependent performance function $G(\textbf{X},\textbf{Y}(t),t)$
%involves input random variables $\textbf{X}$, random processes $\textbf{Y}(t)$ and time $t$. However, by using some process representations such as Karhunen-Loeve (KL) transformation or 
%spectral representation \cite{Loeve1977} the general problem can be reduced to an explicit performance function ($G(\textbf{X},t)$).

%The main objective of a time-variant reliability analysis is to calculate the cumulative probability of failure for a system. It tries to measure the probability of having at least one 
%failure over a given period of time $[t_0, t_l]$, see Equation \ref{eq:cum}. In the other hand, an instantaneous failure probability can be defined for each time instant $t$ as in Equation 
%\ref{eq:inst}. Figure \ref{fig:cum-inst} shows the difference between these two failure probabilities \cite{Melchers1999}. 
%
%\begin{equation}
%P_{f,c}(t_0,t_l) = \textrm{Prob}(\exists\tau \in [t_0, t_l] , G(\textbf{X},\tau) \leq 0)
%\label{eq:cum}
%\end{equation}

%\begin{equation}
%P_{f,i}(t) = \textrm{Prob}(G(\textbf{X},t) \leq 0)
%\label{eq:inst}
%\end{equation}

%\begin{figure*}[hbt!]

%  \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{figures/fig-ch1/performanceink.pdf}
%  \caption{An illustration of instantaneous and cumulative probability of failure}
%  \label{fig:cum-inst}
%\end{figure*}

%Time adds an extra dimension to the classical reliability problem and makes it more difficult to solve. Achieving a reasonable trade-off between efficiency and accuracy is still a challenge in
%this field \cite{Hawcharthesis2017}. This is even more difficult for problems with low probabilities of failure while computationally expensive functions are involved. The methods and approaches 
%for time-dependent reliability assessment are reviewed in the next chapter where a new time-dependent reliability method is proposed. This method is called AK-SYS-T which can easily compete with 
%available methods in literature regarding to accuracy and efficiency. 

%talk about the time dependent problems and that they are going to be addressed in Chapter 2.

$\bullet$ \textit{Risk} is simply defined by multiplying the probability of failure with its associated consequences $C$ as shown in Equation \ref{eq:risk} \citep{BARONE201421}.
Methods and approaches for reliability assessment can also be used here to calculate the failure probability in a risk-based framework.
Risk-based decision making has become an important tool for structural maintenance optimization because, in most of the cases, it is necessary to put the consequences of 
structural failure into consideration.  

\begin{equation}
 R = p_f\times C
 \label{eq:risk}
\end{equation}

\noindent
One way to evaluate consequences of a failure is to identify the losses associated with failure and their equivalent cost. The failure cost can be divided into direct and indirect costs. The 
direct cost, $C_{dir}$, is related to the monetary loss after failure while the indirect cost $C_{ind}$ takes into account the cost related to the impacts on the environment, society, and etc. 
Therefore, the Risk can be formulated by Equation \ref{eq:riskcost}, as:

\begin{equation}
 R = p_f\times (C_{dir}+C_{ind})
 \label{eq:riskcost}
\end{equation}

\noindent
In real life applications, reliability and risk are generally evaluated at constant time intervals. For instance, one year time interval can be used to evaluate the annual reliability index and annual risk
\cite{BARONE201421}. 

\subsection{Availability and hazard indicators}
\noindent
Another way to provide indicators for LCM is through structural lifetime distributions \citep{Leemis}. In this way, time to failure of a component or system is considered as a continuous random variable. 
The random time to failure $T_f$ is defined as the amount of time that has elapsed since the beginning of the service life until the first failure happens \citep{Rausand2003}. The PDF of time to failure 
$f_{T_f}$ should be determined using the statistical information of the degradation process. For a given time $t$ and a small time interval $\Delta t$, this PDF measures the failure probability between 
$t$ and $t+\Delta t$ as expressed in Equation \ref{eq:pdfttofail}. 

\begin{equation}
 f_{T_f}  = \lim_{\Delta t\to\infty} \frac{P(t\leq T_f \leq (t+\Delta t))}{\Delta t} 
 \label{eq:pdfttofail}
\end{equation}
if $\Delta t$ is small it can be rewritten as: 

\begin{equation}
 f_{T_F} \Delta t \approx P(t\leq T_f \leq (t+\Delta t))
 \label{eq:ttofail}
\end{equation}
\noindent
With this respect multiple lifetime functions can be defined such as survivor, availability and hazard functions which have already been successfully employed for LCM of bridges 
\citep{orcesi2011, okasha2009, YANG200439}. Among different lifetime functions, availability and hazard are appropriate indicators that can be used for threshold-based approaches for
LCM \citep{BARONE201421}. Before introducing these functions, let first introduce the survival function $S(t)$. This functions measures the probability that a component or system 
has not failed until time $t$, see Equation \ref{eq:survive}. 

\begin{equation}
 S(t) = P(T_f \geq t)
 \label{eq:survive}
\end{equation}

The availability $A(t)$ function is based on the same definition as the survival function except that it is not monotonous with time, i.e. it can change over time by applying maintenance actions 
, whereas survivor function is a non-monotonous decreasing function over time.

The hazard function $h(t)$ is rather defined as the instantaneous failure rate of a component or system. It expresses that failure occurs between $t$ and $\Delta t$ given that no failure has
happened before $t$. It finds the probability of failure at time interval $[t, t+\Delta t]$ given that the component or system is surviving 
at time $t$ while this probability is averaged over the same interval and $\Delta t$ tends to zero. The hazard function can also be seen as the ratio between the derivative of survivor function 
*$S'(t)$ and survivor function, see Equation \ref{eq:hazard}.

\begin{equation}
 h(t) = \lim_{\Delta t\to 0} \frac{P[t \leq T_f \leq t+\Delta t | T_f \geq t]}{\Delta t} = - \frac{S'(t)}{S(t)}
 \label{eq:hazard}
\end{equation}

Providing a closed form solutions is the main advantage of the lifetime functions over performance-based indicators. However, this closed form solution can be obtained
only for the systems in which the components are independent or fully correlated. Moreover, by resorting to lifetime distributions of components and therefore using availability and hazard functions, 
one cannot access to the sources of uncertainties. In the contrary, reliability and risk-based approaches or more generally probabilistic approaches allow one to study the effect or sensitivity of the 
model response, e.g. $G$, to each input random variable. Any level of correlation between random variables can also be considered \citep{BARONE201421}.  
 


\section{Fatigue assessment of steel structures}
\label{sec:fatigue}

\noindent
Fatigue is a multi-stage process that is caused and accumulates under cyclic loadings \citep{Ye2014}. It starts with initiation of cracks at a microscopic level in the first stage. The cracks 
propagate under cyclic loading in the next stage and it continues until the failure of components or specimen happens in the last stage. The separation of aforementioned stages is not well defined 
\citep{Ellyin1997}. Fatigue cracks usually initiate on the surface of a specimen due to several factors (surface roughness, surface treatment, etc.) and they propagate in the same direction 
of the maximum shear stress. 
Fatigue cracking mostly happens in the regions with high stress concentration e.g. near notches, pits, scratches, or notch like valleys on the surface. The main factors that affect the 
fatigue life can be related to material properties, processing and manufacturing of the material, loading condition, geometry of the components, and surrounding environment. Moreover, 
some of these factors can be correlated meaning that a change in one would lead to a change to another \citep{Fisher1998}. 

Two main life-assessment procedures exist to predict fatigue failure. The first approach named safe-life approach and it is advised when inspections are impossible, very difficult, or costly. 
Cracks are not allowed and must not appear during the service life. This fatigue design approach mostly relies on S-N curves which basically provide a relationship between stress levels and 
number of stress cycles to failure. The second approach us called damage-tolerance approach \citep{Ye2014}. It assumes that components are potentially flawed before their use and therefore,
cracks are assumed to exist at important structural details. In such an approach, inspections are mandatory and the objective is to ensure that the component does not fail between inspections. 
This approach resorts to fracture mechanics and crack growth theories. The basics of fatigue S-N curves and fracture mechanism approaches are briefly reviewed hereafter. More comprehensive
information about those approaches can be found in \citet{Ellyin1997, Fisher1998, lukic1999} for example. 

\subsection{S-N curve based approach}
\noindent
S-N or W\"ohler curves usually characterize the fatigue behavior of different materials \citep{SUSMEL20091074, SUSMEL20111075}. An illustration of S-N curve is provided in Figure 
\ref{fig:s-n}. S-N curves 
show the relation between the stress ranges $S$ and the number of cycles $N$ to failure for a given stress range. For stress ranges higher than ultimate stress limit $S_{ut}$, 
it does not take so long to fail and only few cycles are enough to cause fatigue failure. By contrast, if the stress range is smaller than the endurance limit $S_e$, if it exists,
failure is assumed to never happen. 

\begin{figure*}[hbt!]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.65\linewidth]{figures/fig-ch1/s-n.pdf}
  \caption{A typical S-N curve}
  \label{fig:s-n}
\end{figure*}

S-N curves are obtained from fatigue test campaigns. In a fatigue test, a test specimen goes under a cyclic loading with a constant amplitude until fatigue failure happens. As the stress 
ranges are getting closer to the endurance limit, the number of cycles to failure increases, see Figure \ref{fig:s-n}. The experiments are performed for given test specimen and lab conditions. 
Therefore, the fatigue behavior of the fatigue details, components, or structures in real conditions might be different. 

A commonly used method to represent the finite life zone of the S-N curve is the Basquin model \citep{Basquin1910} which can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
 NS^m = A 
 \label{eq:basquin1}
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}
 logN = -mlogS + logA
 \label{eq:basquin2}
\end{equation}
where $m$ and $A$ are material parameters. 

%Methods based on stress-life can be divided into three main categories according to the stress analysis of structural details that are: (1) nominal stress method, (2) hot spot stress methods,
%and (3) effective notch stress method \cite{FRICKE2003185, RADAJ1996153}. The first category is a generic method to predict the fatigue life of steel bridges. Hot spot stress methods is used 
%for more complicated fatigue details since it has a better accuracy than the nominal stress method. The last category is focusing on predicting the crack initiation life at the root of a notch
%\cite{RADAJ200691, RADAJ1990208}.

One of the simplest and most common ways to calculate the cumulative damage caused by fatigue is the Miner's rule that is formulated in Equation \ref{eq:miner} \citep{miner1945}.
Miner's rule states that the damage caused by a stress cycle belonging to a variable amplitude load history is equal to the damage caused 
by the same cycle in a constant amplitude load history. Therefore, the order of the cycles has no influence on fatigue damage accumulation. In the Miner's rule, $n_i$ is the number 
of stress cycles for the stress range $\Delta \sigma_i$ extracted from the variable amplitude load history and
$N_i$ denotes the number of cycles to failure for  $\Delta \sigma_i$ in the constant amplitude load history that can be approximated using S-N curves. it is generally assumed that failure 
happens when the amount of the accumulative damage $D$ is equal to 1. 

\begin{equation}
 D = \sum_i \frac{n_i}{N_i}
 \label{eq:miner}
\end{equation}

Simplicity is one main advantage of this fatigue design procedure that makes it very well-known and explains why it remains the mostly used method in industry. 
However, one drawback is that this method ignores the effect of the load cycles under the endurance limit $S_e$ (if defined) on fatigue damage, 
although a notable portion of fatigue damage comes from those stress cycles according to \citet{MARQUIS2011208, lukic1999}. Another shortcoming of this approach is that it is not intended 
to incorporate some inspection results e.g. crack dimensions. This can be an issue for aging structures for which it is desirable to extend their service life or if cracks have to be considered 
before the beginning of the service life. For those purposes, fatigue damage approach based on fracture mechanism is introduced in the following. 

\subsection{Fracture mechanism based approach}

\noindent
Another common approach for fatigue assessment is based on Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanism (LEFM). LEFM can be applied under linear elastic assumptions and small scale yielding at the crack tip. 
In such a framework, Stress Intensity Factors (SIF) denoted by $K(a, \sigma)$ represent the amplitude of the stress fields near the crack tip. According to Paris, the SIF is a driving force for 
crack expansion. Hence, \citet{paris1963} have proposed a model that links the crack growth speed ($da/dN$) to the SIF, K, see Equation \ref{eq:paris}. 

\begin{equation}
 \frac{da}{dN}= C(\Delta K)^m
 \label{eq:paris}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $\Delta K$ is the SIF range, and C and m are parameters related to the material. $\Delta K$ is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of stress intensity 
for each stress range. SIF is usually given by Equation \ref{eq:stressintensity}, where $Y(a)$ is defined based on the crack and component geometry and $S$ denotes the stress 
range \citep{broek1986, RITCHIE1973639}. Depending on the complexity of the geometry either closed form solutions exist for $\Delta K$ or Finite Element (FE) analysis is required to assess it
\citep{LI201921, QIAN19921003}. 

\begin{equation}
 \Delta K= SY(a)\sqrt{\pi a}
 \label{eq:stressintensity}
\end{equation}

As it can be seen from the Figure \ref{fig:fracture} crack propagation can be divided into three stages. In the first stage, for low values of $\Delta K$ near $\Delta K_{th}$ underlying mechanisms
are not continuous. Before $\Delta K_{th}$, fatigue cracks are assumed to be inactive. In the second stage, the crack propagation shows a linear behavior and it can 
be described by Paris-Erdogan's law. In the third stage, the crack propagation has a nonlinear behavior when $K_{max}$ gets closer to the fracture toughness $K_c$. Fatigue failure happens for 
$K_{max} > K_c$ \citep{Ritchie1999}. 

\begin{figure*}[hbt!]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{figures/fig-ch1/fracture.pdf}
  \caption{Paris law region}
  \label{fig:fracture}
\end{figure*}

\noindent
Fatigue crack propagation models based on fracture mechanism are appropriate tools to study structural fatigue life for existing structures since they have already experienced real life loading conditions
and therefore may have developed cracks in critical locations. Characteristics of the crack, geometry, and loading conditions should be incorporated in this approach. Fracture mechanism provides a 
framework that allows to evaluate the time-dependent crack length which in turn can be used to decide the inspection schedule. 

Before employing fatigue models, one should keep in mind that they are associated with significant amount of uncertainties. Consequently, uncertainty quantification and probabilistic modeling 
for fatigue life assessment is essential. In the next part, uncertainty modelling in fatigue life analysis is discussed. 


\subsection{Uncertainty modeling in fatigue}

\noindent
Fatigue life assessment is highly influenced by several sources of uncertainties which can be classified in three different types such as natural variability, data Uncertainties, and model uncertainty. 
These sources of uncertainty can exist in both S-N approach and fracture mechanism. For instance, Table \ref{tab:fatigueuncertainty} represents some sources of uncertainty in fracture mechanism approach. 
\citep{Sankararaman2009, LING2011868}. It is necessary therefore to rely on probabilistic modeling to take into account those sources of uncertainties. Performing a probabilistic fatigue life assessment 
requires to identify, quantify, and take them into account properly. The aim of this sections therefore is to introduce some of main sources of uncertainty in fatigue assessment. 

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering

\begin{tabular}{p{0.4\textwidth} p{0.5\textwidth}}
\hline
Type & \hspace{0.8cm} Sources of uncertainty \\

\end{compactitem}\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\caption{Sources of uncertainty in fatigue crack growth }
\label{tab:fatigueuncertainty}  
\end{table}

Regarding to the uncertainties in fatigue loading, previous experimental studies have shown that fatigue life and crack propagation behavior is highly influenced by the variability and uncertainty 
in the loading spectrum \citep{MORENO2003597, ZAPATERO2005878}. Uncertainties in loading can be originated by characteristics of a) operational environment such as temperature, wind, road profile, 
etc., b) mission type or service use
that can be normal or emergency use, military or commercial use, etc., and c) human factors like traffic loading, maneuvers, and customer usage. Fatigue load spectrum is usually modeled by 
cycle counting and random process methods. Rainflow counting is the most common method among the cycle counting methods which extracts the counting matrices from the loading spectrum that include 
information about the number of load cycles, the range and the mean value of each load cycle \citep{Dowling1971FatigueFP}. 

Methods based on random process try to model the load spectrum as a stochastic process. Markov chain method lies in this category in which the load spectrum is treated as a discrete time Markov chain 
that has a stationary probability matrix \citep{KRENK1989247}. Time domain and frequency domain based methods can be used to model a random process with a continuous state space. Time domain based 
methods are more appropriate to model load spectrum according to issues related to fatigue damage prognosis such as inspection and maintenance scheduling that are defined in the time domain \citep{LING2011868}. 
With this respect, time series methods such as ARMA or ARIMA are time domain based methods and they can be used to model the load spectrum \citep{BENASCIUTTI2007232}. \citet{LING2011868} have
investigated load models such as rainflow counting, discrete time Markov chain, and ARMA. They have assessed the predictive confidence of all models and the results show that all models work well. 
However, the overall confidence metric based on the presented numerical example show that ARMA has the best support from the loading data. They also have shown that additional information about the 
load spectrum on the structure obtained by SHM can help to update the model parameters. It should be mentioned that methods such as rainflow counting, Markov chain, and ARMA are assuming that the 
load spectrum is a stationary process. 

In most of cases, structural loading such as traffic show a seasonality effect meaning that the traffic loading might have a different behavior in different times during the year. This causes 
non-stationarity in the load spectrum and previously mentioned methods are incapable of dealing with this issue. However, some methods in time series analysis such as seasonal ARIMA can deal with 
seasonality effect. Therefore, a study has been performed within this thesis to employ seasonal ARIMA to prepare
a load model for long-term monitoring data. This study is presented in Appendix A and it proposes an approach that enables to use seasonal ARIMA for long-term monitoring data on structures. Seasonal
ARIMA makes it possible to take into account the seasonal effect in traffic loading. In addition, this approach can be used also to deal with the missing data and predict the future loading somehow.

Providing suitable approaches to model the load spectrum is an important step for fatigue probabilistic modeling. However, another important issue with this respect is to calculate local stresses in the 
proximity of fatigue region. Local stresses are also influenced by some parameters such as overall loading, fatigue detail geometry, residual stresses, etc. Calculated stress ranges and number of 
stress cycles can directly be used in S-N approach to evaluate the remaining fatigue life. Within the fracture mechanism approach they are used to calculate SIF. FE analysis is a common way that
is used to calculate local stresses. One of the important issues that affect the accuracy in this method is the mesh size \citep{SANKARARAMAN2011}. Assuming that the boundary conditions are provided 
properly, a small mesh 
size will lead to almost accurate solutions. This, however, is very difficult to implement in practice since it needs a huge computation time. Surrogate models like Kriging can be used to accelerate
the calculation of stresses or SIF. In this way a few FE model is evaluated for few runs to prepare the Design of Experiment (DoE) for Kriging. Kriging provide exact outputs for the DoE and for the 
other points provide a Kriging variance that shows the level of uncertainty on the prediction. The accuracy of the Kriging meta-model depends on the accuracy of the FE model that is used for DoE and
the calculation of Kriging parameters \citep{SANKARARAMAN2011}. 

Initial crack size is another source of uncertainty related to the natural variability. Some factors such as welding procedure, type of joint, fabrication yard, etc. affect the initial crack size. 
The crack propagation behavior for small cracks is very unusual. Introducing an Equivalent Initial Crack Size (EICS) is one way to avoid the analysis of crack propagation in microscopic scale 
\citep{Sankararaman2009, LIU2009476}. Therefore, in crack propagation models like Paris law that deals with long cracks, the propagation related to microscopic cracks is replaced with an EICS. This quantity 
cannot be measured by experiments therefore some researchers consider its value between 0.25 to 1 mm for metals \citep{MERATI2007673, gallagher1984usaf}. Some studies consider EICS as a random
variable in which they use lognormal distribution to model the uncertainty \citep{Wirsching1984}. 

Uncertainties in the material properties is another source of uncertainty in fatigue assessment which can be either related to natural variability or data uncertainty which exist in both S-N curves
and fracture mechanism approaches. This uncertainty can be related to the type of material, manufacturing and preparation, and test conditions.
In S-N curves material characteristics are represented by parameters $m$ and $A$. The large scatter observed in number of cycles to failure in S-N curves is 
due to the uncertainty in material properties. Parameters $m$ and $A$ are highly correlated therefore it is useful to consider one of them as a fixed parameter and the other one as a random variable. 
Fatigue tests can be used to identify the parameters of the desired random variable. This is the same for material parameters, $m$ and $C$, in fracture mechanism approach. similarly, there is a high 
correlation between these two parameters therefore one of them can be considered as a fixed parameter and the other on as a random variable \citep{Wirsching1984}. 

As it was mentioned before, according to the Miner's hypothesis for linear damage accumulation using S-N curves, the fatigue failure occurs when the cumulative damage is equal to 1. Although, 
fatigue tests under varying amplitude loading shows a spread from this value which means that the Miner's sum ($\Delta$) should be treated as random variable. This randomness can be caused 
because of the model error in Miner's hypothesis. It has been proposed in sum studies to treat the Miner's sum as a log-normal variable with the mean of 1 \citep{Wirsching1984}. According to the 
crack growth model, plenty of crack propagation laws can be noticed in the literature (e.g. Paris law, Foreman's equation \citep{MINGUEZ1994663}, Weertman's equation \citep{WEERTMAN1984563}, etc.)
which shows non of them can be applied 
commonly to all crack propagation problems. Apart from the uncertainties in the coefficients of the crack propagation model there is also a model error than needs to be considered. For instance 
if one uses Paris law for crack propagation, it can be formulated as in Equation \ref{eq:pariserror} where $\varepsilon_{cg}$ is the error for the crack growth model \citep{Sankararaman2009}. 

\begin{equation}
 \frac{da}{dN}= C(\Delta K)^m + \varepsilon_{cg}
 \label{eq:pariserror}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Performance functions for fatigue reliability assessment}
\label{subsec:fatigueperformance}
\noindent
As said before fatigue life assessment is associated with large amount of uncertainties. A reliability-based fatigue life assessment is a rational way to treat uncertainties coming from 
natural randomness, modeling errors, and prediction imperfections \citep{Byers1997}. In this context one can define the probability of failure as the probability of violating one or more limit states. 
Limit state is the boundary between the failure and the safe domain defined by structural performance function denoted $G$ in Subsection \ref{sec:riliabilityandrisk} which mathematically expresses a 
given failure criterion. For many mechanical problems, a "stress-strength" definition is used. The "stress" represents a given structural response, i.e. local Van Mises stresses, and the "strength" 
denotes the material capacity of the structure, i.e. the yield stress. The "stress" and "strength" can be input and output variables, e.g. the results of the propagation of input uncertainties 
through a mechanical model. In both S-N and fracture based approaches performance function can be expressed by the difference between the "stress" and the "strength" \citep{BARONE201421}. 

\begin{equation}
 G(t) = R(t) - Q(t)
 \label{eq:S-Nlimit}
\end{equation}

\noindent
\textbf{S-N based approach} performance function can be described in different forms. A common way to provide the performance function in this approach is in terms of damage. This can be expressed
by Equations \ref{eq:S-Nlimit1} and \ref{eq:S-Nlimit2}. In the first case the cumulative damage $D_L$ should be less than Miner's sum (in most of cases $D_L=1$) while in the second case a the 
cumulative damage should be less than a target damage $\Delta_{target}$. 
\begin{equation}
 Z = \Delta -D_L 
 \label{eq:S-Nlimit1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 Z = \Delta_{target} -D_L
 \label{eq:S-Nlimit2}
\end{equation}
\noindent
Another way to express the performance function for this approach is based on the number of cycles to failure $N_c$. If the total number of stress cycles to failure under variable stress range is $N_t$ 
then the performance function can be formulated as Equation \ref{eq:S-Nlimit3}. For further information about formulation of $N_t$ and $N_c$ refer to \citep{LIU201077}.
\begin{equation}
 Z = N_t - N_c 
 \label{eq:S-Nlimit3}
\end{equation}
\noindent
As said before, it is common to assume the Miner's sum as unity and the failure happens when the cumulative damage is more than 1. The damage caused by each stress range can be estimated using S-N 
curves that are usually provided by performing plenty of fatigue tests under constant amplitude loading conditions for different stress ranges \citep{SZERSZEN199983}. To make good conclusions about 
the fatigue failure using this approach, it is necessary to properly estimate the stress ranges and the number of stress cycles. 

\noindent
\textbf{Fracture based approach} has been used in many studies for fatigue reliability analysis, see e.g. \citet{Park2005, Ye2014}. 
As far as fracture mechanism of steel structures is concerned, two failure modes can be considered. The first failure mode, named brittle failure, is derived under LEFM assumptions when a crack exists in
the structure. In such a framework, a static failure can be defined when the crack driving force expressed in terms of SIF ($K$) exceeds the fracture toughness $K_c$: 
\begin{equation}
K(a, \sigma) \geq K_c
 \label{eq:brittle1}
\end{equation}
The fracture toughness, also named tenacity, refers to material ability to withstand unstable cracking. This equation can be equivalently rewritten by: 
\begin{equation}
 K_r=\frac{K(a, \sigma)}{K_c} \leq 1
 \label{eq:brittle2}
\end{equation}
In equations \ref{eq:brittle1} and \ref{eq:brittle2}, $a$ stands for the current crack length and $\sigma$ for the peak stress of the current fatigue cycle. The criterion $K_r$ shows the proximity 
to the brittle failure. 

The second failure mode, named ductile failure, happens on any structure, even on structures without cracks, subjected to an increasing loading. The criterion is expressed by Equation \ref{eq:plastic}.
Where $P$ corresponds to the applied load, $P_L(a, \sigma_y)$ is the value of $P$ corresponding to the plastic collapse of the material which naturally depends on the yield stress $\sigma_y$ and crack 
length $a$, and $L_r^{max}$ is the threshold value that is a function of the material flow stress and yield stress.  
\begin{equation}
 L_r = \frac{P}{P_L} \leq L_r^{max}
 \label{eq:plastic}
\end{equation}

Interactions between brittle failure and pure plastic collapse (e.g. for structures without crack) for some material (i.e. with ductile behavior, for which LEFM assumptions do not apply) and/or under specific 
loading conditions lead to intermediate configurations known as ductile tearing. In such cases the performance function should encompass both criteria \ref{eq:brittle2} and \ref{eq:plastic}. One solution 
is to resort to the R6 curve based rule, see Figure \ref{fig:r6}, which has been originally proposed by \citet{harrison1977}. The performance function $G(L_r, K_r)$ may have different closed-form 
expressions. According to \citet{Kunz:31501} $G(L_r, K_r)$ can be represented by Equation \ref{eq:combined}.

\begin{figure*}[hbt!]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/fig-ch1/R-6.jpg}
  \caption{Schematic representation of different modes of failure in R6}
  \label{fig:r6}
\end{figure*}

\begin{equation}
G(L_r, K_r) =  
\begin{cases}\!% alignment adjustment
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+0.5L_r^2}} - K_r  & L_r \leq1\\
0  & L_r >1
\end{cases}
\label{eq:combined}
\end{equation}

Another common way to formulate a performance function within the fracture based approach is according to the crack length. In this way, the failure happens when the crack length at time t, $a(\textbf{X},t)$
is greater than a given critical crack length $a_{cr}$. Where $\textbf{X}$ denotes the vector of input random variables. The performance function hence can be formulated by Equation \ref{eq:lengrh}.
\begin{equation}
 G(\textbf{X},t)= a_{cr}-a(\textbf{X},t)
 \label{eq:lengrh}
\end{equation}
\noindent
In this section, several types of performance functions for fatigue reliability assessment (according to S-N and and fracture mechanism approaches) for steel structures have been reviewed. As said before,
the main goal of fatigue reliability analysis is to compute the failure probability of components that exposed to fatigue. An extensive review of methods and approaches for evaluating the failure probability
is provided in Chapter 3. 

%Studies related to the fatigue reliability assessment using fracture mechanics can involve wide range of uncertainties within the calculations. \citep{ZHAO1996775} propose a reliability model by
%considering uncertainties such as initial crack size, crack aspect ratio, material properties and number of stress cycles. Field data are used to reduce the uncertainty on the mentioned parameters.
%Welded joints introduce regions prone to fatigue on the structures due to the initial flaws and higher stress concentration. Transverse-stiffener-to-bottom-flange welds are typical welded joints 
%in steel bridges. A probabilistic crack growth model using fracture mechanism for these details is presented in \cite{Lukic2001}. A bilinear crack growth model is used in \citep{RIGHINIOTIS2003867}
%to predict the fatigue life of welded joints within a probabilistic fracture mechanism under constant amplitude loading. Extreme loads can increase the crack propagation speed and may cause sudden 
%failures if the crack has been already developed to some level. Hence, fatigue reliability of steel bridges under seismic loading is studied in \citep{PIPINATO2011202} by using a probabilistic 
%fracture mechanism approach. Fatigue reliability of existing structures can be updated by monitoring data and inspections. \citet{Wang20121} have used the data coming from the non-destructive testing 
%accompanied with Bayes theorem and a probabilistic fracture mechanism to evaluate and update the fatigue reliability of existing steel bridges. Also \cite{Guo2013} have employed the long-term 
%monitoring data to assess the fatigue reliability of the welded joints in a box-girder bridge using the linear elastic fracture mechanics.

\section{Monitoring, inspection and maintenance for fatigue}
\label{sec:mon-fatig}
\noindent
An accurate prediction of structural performance is the core of structural maintenance planning and LCM. With this respect inspections and SHM can play a crucial role. SHM provides real time 
information about the structural responses under the real loading conditions and inspections provide information about the actual fatigue damage level for the critical locations \cite{Frang2011}. 
An accurate knowledge about the fatigue behavior in critical locations on the structure is of paramount importance for decision makers to allocate proper maintenance strategies. Maintenance actions
against fatigue usually try to reduce or terminate the fatigue damage propagation. Table \ref{tab:interventions} summerizes some actions related to SHM, inspections, and maintenance for fatigue and 
the following part provides a brief introduction on some basic concepts of SHM, inspections, and maintenance for structures suffering from fatigue.

\end{table}


\subsection{SHM}
\noindent
SHM is a process focusing on observing, measuring, recording, and processing of actual data related to the structure. It provides valuable information about the current state of a structure
under real loading conditions (e.g. loading, local stresses, crack geometry,etc.) \citep{Cremona2018}. During the past years, practices in SHM have significantly changed due to the developments 
in information technology. Advances in monitoring 
technology such as smart sensors, data storage, etc. make it possible to have a better snapshot of the structural behavior under different loading conditions \citep{Cai2016BigDA}. Methods in SHM 
are mostly based on installing sensors on structures 
to continuously monitor and record their response which enables in turns to identify and localize the damage. SHM can generally be used for several reasons such as validation of design assumptions, recording 
the structural response under normal operating conditions, damage detection, and useful life estimation \citep{Zhu2013, ZHU20131836}. SHM can be very fruitful for fatigue life assessment by providing information 
about crack length, stress ranges and average number of cycles on a detail, etc. Acoustic emission, ultrasonic guided waves, and Lamb waves are among several SHM techniques that are commonly used to 
monitor and detect fatigue damage \citep{Ciang2008}. Acoustic emission has received more attention within the past decade. In this method, special sensors are used to record 
the stress waves that are expelled because of the changes inside the material. The recorded information can be used to detect some damages such as crack initiation and propagation, plastic deformation,
corrosion, etc. \citep{Anastasopoulos2009}. Some other fatigue related monitoring systems employ strain gauges and accelerometers for example to measure stress levels and average number of load 
cycles on the critical fatigue locations. Before selecting a monitoring strategy for fatigue, one should consider material and geometry of the structure, potential defects, accuracy of the monitoring 
data, installation cost, operation and maintenance of the monitoring system, etc. \citep{SOLIMAN201691}. 

\subsection{Inspections}
\noindent
Inspections on the structures are usually performed visually on a regular basis. The time interval between inspection, for bridges for example, can be defined by different factors such as the volume of 
the traffic, age of the bridge, and the bridge condition. In the USA, 95 percent of the inspections are done at the intervals of 2 years or less. Road agencies in other countries, however, perform 
detailed inspections at intervals of 5 to 6 years along with less detailed check inspection at 1 to 3 year intervals \citep{NAP14127}. In France for instance, l'Instruction Technique pour la Surveillance 
et l'Entretien 
des Ouvrages d'Art (ITSEOA) is responsible for establishment of the procedure for inspection of most roadway infrastructures. Inspection planning for bridges according to regulations of ITSEOA is 
described in Table \ref{tbl:inspection-france}. Four types of routine inspections can be identified from this table such as routine visit, annual inspection, IQOA (Image de la Qualité des Ouvrages
d'Art: Image of the Quality of Bridges) assessment, and detailed inspection \citep{ITSEOA1979}.  

\begin{table}[hbt!]
  \caption{Inspection types, France}
  \label{tbl:inspection-france}
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/fig-ch1/inspection-france.png}
\end{table}

The simplest method to perform structural inspection is visual inspection that is done by human eyes and some optical devices. 
The quality of the inspection results are highly dependent on the visual acuity and color vision of the inspector, the rush level of the inspector, and accessibility to the inspection zone. Therefore, 
it is hard to ensure that inspections can detect fatal problems \citep{Swartz2009DamageCO}. By employing visual inspections for fatigue damage one could face notable limitations especially when fatigue cracks 
are small or if they occur in subsurface areas. For this reason, it is better to resort to more reliable techniques such as magnetic penetrant, ultrasonic, and 
eddy current methods for critical fatigue details  \citep{Fisher1998, Moan2005, Ciang2008}. In magnetic method, magnetic particles are used to detect discontinuities in steel plates. These can be  
indications for existence of 
cracks in smooth surfaces. The accuracy of this method would decrease on welded surfaces \citep{Demsetz1996}. In penetrant methods, a liquid with low viscosity and high capillary is used. After 
cleaning the surface, this liquid with red color is applied (on the surface) and cracks become visible by spraying a developer on the surface. Like the previous method, this method is efficient on 
smooth surfaces \citep{Fisher1998}. High frequency sound waves are used in ultrasonic methods. A distortion in the reflected wave can be an indication of a crack. This method is good for steel plates 
with a thickness greater than 3 mm, but it requires high-skilled operators \citep{SOLIMAN201691}. Eddy currents can also be used to detect cracks near surface in steel. Eddy current is produced by 
electromagnetic induction. Cracks then lead to some changes in the current that is detectable. Applying this method also requires well-trained inspectors \citep{Hellier2012, Demsetz1996}. 
Employing an inspection method to detect fatigue cracks is in general limited to a single critical location and it would be unfit to be used for scanning all the fatigue critical locations efficiently.
However, monitoring systems make it possible to detect the long-term fatigue damage in multiple critical regions efficiently and reliably \citep{ANTONACI201226}. 

\subsection{Maintenance}
\noindent
Maintenance against fatigue can be grouped into different categories such as surface treatments, through-thickness repair of cracks, and modification of details or structures \citep{FHWA2013}. Surface
treatment usually involves grinding, applying Gas Tungsten Arc (GTA), and impact treatments. Grinding is used to remove a small portion of the fatigue detail that involves small cracks. Then, GTA is
used to remelt (a weld toe for example) to remove the small discontinuities and to reduce the stress concentration. Impact treatment is the last step that is used to reduce the crack initiation and
propagation speed by applying a compressive residual stress on the weld toe, improving the geometry, or reshaping the weld toe \citep{Fisher1998}. Another common method to stop fatigue crack
propagation through thickness is to drill a hole with a large-enough diameter at the tip of the crack. Depending on the size and location of the hole it can either be considered as long-term or
short-term maintenance \citep{Connor2017}. Some repair actions aim to reproduce the same condition as before cracking. We can quote cutting out and re-fabricating some parts of components, where cracks 
through the thickness exist \citep{Fisher1998}. Another way to reduce fatigue crack propagation is to increase the cross sectional area by adding some cover plates. In this way the stress concentration 
around the crack is decreased which mitigates the crack propagation speed. An interested reader about the field would find more details about repair and maintenance methods against fatigue can be found in 
\citep{Fisher1998, Connor2017, FHWA2013}. 


\section{Life-Cycle optimization with maintenance, monitoring, and inspection}
\label{sec:opt-fatig}
\noindent
As said before an accurate evaluation of structural performance during its service life helps decision makers to decide about possible maintenance and repair actions. However, financial resources are limited
and cannot cover all costs related to maintenance. Life-cycle cost is one of the most regular cost-based indicators that is used within many decision making processes to assess associated costs within the 
service life of a structure \cite{Frangopol1997}. Including the cost of SHM ($C_{mon}$), the expected total life-cycle cost of a structure, $C_{life}$, can be formulated as: 
\begin{equation}
 C_{life} = C_{int} + C_{insp} + C_{mon} + C_{ma} +C_{fail}
 \label{eq:lifecost}
\end{equation}
\noindent
where $C_{int}$ is the initial cost; $C_{insp}$ is the cost of inspection; $C_{ma}$ is the cost of maintenance; and $C_{fail}$ is the failure cost \citep{Frangopol1997}. Maintenance, inspection, and monitoring
can be available in different types. Assuming that there are $i$ types of inspections, $j$ types monitoring, and $k$ types of maintenance that are employed during the lifetime of a structure, their cost can 
be formulated as following equations respectively \citep{SOLIMAN201691}. 
\begin{equation}
 C_{insp} = C_{insp}^1 +...+ C_{insp}^i
 \label{eq:inspcost}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 C_{mon} = C_{mon}^1 +...+ C_{mon}^j
 \label{eq:inspcost}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 C_{ma} = C_{ma}^1 +...+ C_{ma}^k
 \label{eq:inspcost}
\end{equation}
Each type of inspection, maintenance, and monitoring can be applied for several times. Therefore, the cost for each type of inspection, monitoring, and maintenance can be calculated by following equations:
\begin{equation}
C_{insp}^i =  
\begin{cases}\!% alignment adjustment
0  & N_{insp}^i=0\\
\sum_{l=1}^{N_{insp}^i}\frac{C_{insp}^i}{(1+r)^{t_{insp}^{(i, l)}}}  & N_{insp}^i \geq1
\end{cases}
\label{eq:c_insp}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
C_{mon}^j =  
\begin{cases}\!% alignment adjustment
0  & N_{mon}^j=0\\
\sum_{m=1}^{N_{mon}^j}\frac{C_{mon}^j}{(1+r)^{t_{mon}^{(j,m)}}}  & N_{mon}^j \geq1
\end{cases}
\label{eq:c_mon}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
C_{ma}^k =  
\begin{cases}\!% alignment adjustment
0  & N_{ma}^k=0\\
\sum_{n=1}^{N_{ma}^k}\frac{C_{ma}^k}{(1+r)^{t_{ma}^{(k,n)}}}  & N_{ma}^k \geq1
\end{cases}
\label{eq:c_ma}
\end{equation}
where $C_{insp}^i$, $C_{mon}^j$, and $C_{ma}^k$ represent respectively the cost for single inspection of type $i$, monitoring of type $j$, and maintenance of type $k$. $N_{insp}^i $, $N_{mon}^j$, and $N_{ma}^k$ 
are the number of applied inspection of type $i$, monitoring of type $j$, and maintenance of type $k$ respectively. The annual discount rate for money is $r$ and the time for applying $l$th inspection of type $i$,
$m$th monitoring of type $j$, and $n$th maintenance of type $k$ respectively are $t_{insp}^{(i, l)}$, $t_{mon}^{(j,m)}$, and $t_{ma}^{(k,n)}$. It is clear that the maintenance actions are applied to reduce 
the probability of failure $p_f$. Therefore, they can have a direct influence on the cost of failure. By taking the influence of maintenance actions into consideration one can formulate the cost of failure at 
year $T$ by Equation \ref{eq:c_fail} \citep{ORCESI201126}. 
\begin{equation}
 C_{fail}(T) = C_{fail}\times p_f(0) + \sum_{t=1}^{T}\frac{C_{fail}(p_f(t)-p_f(t-1))}{(1+r)^t} 
 \label{eq:c_fail}
\end{equation}
\noindent
Life-cycle cost optimization is an important step within the LCM in which the optimum intervention times and types of maintenance and inspection interventions can be decided according to different 
objectives such as structural performance, cost, and service life \citep{Liu2005, Frang2007}. Figure \ref{fig:lifecyclecost} shows the relationship between the expected life-cycle cost and structural 
performance. It illustrates that the initial cost of a structure increase with a higher expected performance. By contrast, a high performance leads to lower costs for maintenance, and failure. An optimal 
maintenance and inspection strategy can be followed to maintain the structure performing its duties at a predefined performance level $P^*$ while the expected total life-cycle cost is minimized to $C^*$. 
Decision makers usually search for the solutions that falls near this optimal value according to the owner's requirements \citep{Frangopol1997}.

\end{figure*}

Decision making process for maintenance and inspection planning should be performed through an optimization process. This can be formulated as a single or multi-objective 
model. Including more objectives within the optimization process make it possible for more flexible decisions since multiple optimal solutions are provided for the problem according to 
the trade-off between the importance of each objective \citep{Kim2017, KIM2018356}. Different objectives that are considered for the multi-objective optimization can be related to the cost, reliability 
index, damage detection, and service life. 

A multi-objective optimization problem can be generally formulated as following \citep{AUGUSTO2012}:

\begin{equation}
Minimize: \;\; \textbf{f(X)}
\label{eq:objective}
\end{equation}
subject to
\begin{equation}
g_i(\textbf{X})\leq 0, \;\; i=1,...,m
\label{eq:inequalconditions}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
h_j(\textbf{X})= 0, \;\; h=1,...,l
\label{eq:equalconditions}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\textbf{X}_{inf} \leq \textbf{X} \leq \textbf{X}_{inf}
\label{eq:variableconstraint}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\textbf{f(X)} = [f_1, f_2, ..., f_k]^T \;\; :\textbf{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k
\label{eq:objectivevector}
\end{equation}
represents the vector containing the objective functions that are going to be minimized. Decision variables (or design variables) are collected in vector $\textbf{X}$ and they are defined within the 
design space $\mathbb{R}^n$. Decision variables can be bounded between the lower bound $\textbf{X}_{inf}$ and upper bound $\textbf{X}_{inf}$. The three equations \ref{eq:inequalconditions}-\ref{eq:variableconstraint}
define the feasible region for the optimal solutions where $g_i(\textbf{X})$ represents the $i$th inequality constraint function and $h_j(\textbf{X})$ is the $j$th equality constraint function. Inequality
functions here are of type "less than or equal" functions that can represent functions of type "greater or equal" if they are multiplied by -1. likely, for the "minimization" of the functions that can be 
transformed to "maximization" in the same way as constraints. 

Often, minimizing the cost is one of the main objectives within life-cycle optimization. With this respect some studies try to minimize life-cycle cost \cite{Lukic2001}, and others search for the minimum 
maintenance cost \citep{ORCESI2010627}. Other cost-related objectives can be linked to minimizing the failure, inspection, and monitoring costs \citep{SOLIMAN2013996, ORCESI201126}. Improving the structural
performance by maximizing reliability index \citep{Kim2018} or minimizing probability of failure \citep{KIM2018356} is another objective for life-cycle optimization. Another objective that is defined in some 
studies is related to fatigue damage detection. Regarding to this \citet{SOLIMAN2013996} aims at maximizing the probability of fatigue damage detection whereas \citet{KIM2011} try to minimize the damage 
detection delay. Maximizing the extended service life can also be an objective within the multi-objective optimization process that has been considered in \citep{KIM2018356, SOLIMAN201691}. Among possible 
decision variables that can be used in the multi-objective optimization, inspection times and types, maintenance times and types, monitoring starting times and durations are among the most used 
\citep{SOLIMAN201691, KIM2018356, ORCESI201126}. 

An exemplary formulation for a bi-objective maintenance optimization can be formulated as following \citep{OKASHA2009460}. 

\noindent
$\bullet$ Find
\begin{equation}
Maintenance \; application\; times: \; \textbf{t}_{ma}=\{ t_1, t_2, ..., t_n\} 
\label{eq:1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
Maintenance \; types: \; ma_{t_1}, ma_{t_2}, ..., ma_{t_j}
\label{eq:2}
\end{equation}
$\bullet$ Objectives
\begin{equation}
Minimize \; the \; C_{life} 
\label{eq:3}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
Maximize \; annual \; reliability \; index \; \beta \; or \; minimize \; P_f 
\label{eq:4}
\end{equation}
$\bullet$ Such that
\begin{equation}
t_n-t_{n-1}\geq  T_{min} \; years
\label{eq:5}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\beta \geq \beta_{min}
\label{eq:6}
\end{equation}
The goals of the optimization process are a) to minimize the life-cycle cost $C_{life}$ and b) to 
maximize the annual reliability index $\beta$. Decision variables for this problem are maintenance times, $\textbf{t}_{ma}=\{ t_1, t_2, ..., t_n\}$, and maintenance types $ma_{t_1}, ma_{t_2}, ..., 
ma_{t_j}$. The optimization algorithm should search for the optimal solutions under given conditions such as the minimum time between two consecutive repairs should be greater than a given minimum
value $T_{min}$, and also it should search within annual reliability indices that are greater than a given minimum value $\beta_{min}$.


\section{Conclusion and contributions of this study to LCM}
\label{conclusion}
\noindent
As it was discussed in this chapter, Structural LCM is framework combined from different steps and each step performs given duties to play a part in accomplishment of the overall LCM objectives.
Optimizing the structural maintenance planning can be considered as one of the goals of the structural LCM. It is an exhaustive task in which different challenges and obstacles need to be 
properly addressed. To  enumerate some of the challenges in steel structures one can refer to performance prediction under uncertainty, employing SHM data to reduce uncertainties, crack propagation 
behavior for given components, reliability- and cost-informed decision making, and effect of maintenance actions among others. 

In this thesis, studies have been performed to enhance the capabilities of the structural LCM by proposing methods and approaches related to previously mentioned challenges. With this respect,
a new time-dependent reliability method is proposed in Chapter \ref{chapter:ch3} that is called AK-SYS-T. This method provide an efficient and accurate tool to evaluate time-dependent reliability
of a component compared to other available methods. It is worthy to mention that time-dependent reliability analysis is necessary in this context since the performance deterioration (such as fatigue) 
is a time-dependent process and it is associated with time-dependent parameters, e.g. fatigue loading. 

As said before, another contribution of this study to structural LCM is to employ time-series methods such as seasonal ARIMA to provide a load model for long-term fatigue loading that can capture more 
details of the loading scenario regarding the seasonal effects in traffic loading which is an important advantage of this method compared to other methods (e.g. rainflow counting). This approach can be 
used for long-term monitoring data that are recorded with high frequency. It should be noted that employing time series methods for such data is not a straightforward task. More details for this method 
is provided in Appendix A. 

Another related topic that is performed in this context is studying the crack propagation in the root of a fillet weld that is a common fatigue detail in bridges with orthotropic deck plates. One important
issue that is investigated here is the influence of the transversal tension in the deck plate on the direction of the crack propagation. It is shown that increasing the transversal tension in the deck plate
changes the crack propagation towards the deck plate. Such cracks are considered dangerous since they are hard to inspect and detect. To perform this study, advanced tools such as FEM and X-FEM (Extended Finite 
Element Method) are utilized. This study is detailed in Chapter \ref{chapter:ch4}.
